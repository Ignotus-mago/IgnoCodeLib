IgnoCodeLib
===========

IgnoCodeLib library for Processing 2.0, Eclipse project. Distribution: http://paulhertz.net/ignocodelib/index.html. 

Due to my noobiness, I have stuck GlitchSort in the repository. Ignore it unless it's what interests you. 
Will figure how to delete it at some point.

4/4/2016, deleted GlitchSort directory.
